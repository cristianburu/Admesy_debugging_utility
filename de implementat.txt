0.1 - Initial release
      PCM2X Support for internal memory parameters

0.2 - Added PCM2X EEPROM parameters
      Added Hera support
      Simultaneous operation of Hera and PCM2X
      Revamped interface
      More robust error handling
      Various fixes



TODO
===============

- More robust error handling, including autorange
- Implement separate timeouts for measure/parameters, preferably as a user preference
- Include font in distribution
- Implement better spectrum measurement/save results
- Identifiers to implement
            0x1020 : Hera01 - done
            0x1021 : Hera02
            0x1022 : Hera03
            0x1023 : Hera04




INSTRUCTIONS
===============

only a/v calib parameters are implemented

Supported devices

reload param why is good

arparms button why is good

only one device connected

not all parameters are implemented, only relevant to AV calibration
Calibration matrix not implemented
